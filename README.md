# AngularJS Workshop

The MOST efficient way to learn a new coding language or framework is by building a project that uses them. The ol' "get your hands dirty" approach.

In order to get started, clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/pietrot/angularjs-workshop.git
```

Then, run:

```
npm install
grunt dev
```

(You MUST have npm and grunt installed on your computer)

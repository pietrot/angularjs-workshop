# AngularJS Workshop

The MOST efficient way to learn a new coding language or framework is by building a project that uses them. The ol' "get your hands dirty" approach.

In order to get started, clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/pietrot/angularjs-workshop.git
```

Then, run:

```
npm install
grunt dev
```

(You MUST have npm and grunt installed on your computer)

## Workshop

The goal of this workshop is to build a todo list app. I know what you are thinking... todo list apps have be overdone, however there is merit in learning the basics.

### Tasks

1. Implement the following logic:
    a. Browse todo lists.
    b. Create todo list.
    c. Update metadata of todo list (ie. title).
    d. Delete todo list.
    e. Add item to a todo list.
    f. Update item.
    g. Delete item.
    h. (STRETCH GOAL) Move item to another todo list.
2. Implement at least 2 directives (ie. list, list-item).
3. Implement a service layer for managing the data in local storage.
4. Make use of the Promise pattern in the service layer when manipulating the data.
5. Make use of some Emitter pattern for list-based events (ie. add-item, remove-item, etc.).
6. Compile source-code into a distributable package using grunt.
